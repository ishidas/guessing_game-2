    <H3>How I did it using JavaScript</H3>
      <ul>
        <li>By first defining the questions and total correct value as variables, the computer remembers and stores the answers.</li>
        <li>The questions are presented in a prompt tag, followed by 'if' 'else' statements containing alert tags and point value assignment.</li>
        <li>By using 'if' 'else' statements, the computer can determine which answers are correct and which are incorrect.</li>
        <li>The correct answers are valued with a 1 and incorrect answers are valued with a 0 in the 'if' 'else' statements.</li>
        <li>The variable 'score' is taking the sum of the questions (1 for correct, 0 for incorrect), and alerting the user about their score.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Some facts about me.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm a sports addict, both watching and playing. I swim, run, play football on the weekends, and am training for a marathon. Although it is difficult, I remain an avid Bengals and Reds fan.</li>
        <li>Live a block off of Green Lake.</li>
        <li>Works part time for Luxe Valet (see me if you want a day of free on-demand valet parking downtown!).</li>
      </ul>
